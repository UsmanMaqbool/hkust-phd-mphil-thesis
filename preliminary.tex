\begin{center}{\Large\bf Acknowledgment}\normalsize
\end{center}
\vspace{0.5cm}

I would like to express my deep gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Ming Liu who has given me a lot of advice and kindly support in my research during the years of my PhD study. I would like to thank The Punjab Educational Endowment Fund (PEEF) for providing me with the CMMS PhD scholarship award so I had the valuable opportunity to study here. This thesis and the work it embodies would not have been possible without the continual support of a number of individuals and organizations. I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to everyone who has contributed to the fulfillment of this thesis. I want to gratefully acknowledge and express my appreciation to my supervisor, Prof. Ming Liu, for his invaluable guidance, full support and patience through my PhD studies. His outstanding attributes such as humility, diligence, enthusiasm and dedication, together with his amazing academic insights and on-going belief were constant sources of motivation for me. I am truly privileged to have had him as my supervisor. I would like to thank Prof. Roland Siegwart and Dr. Cesar Dario Cadena Lerma from the Autonomous Systems Lab, ETH ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland for kindly welcoming me to visit their research group. The discussions with them stimulated many interesting ideas in my research area of place recognition. Thanks must go to The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology for providing the top up support to my PhD scholarship and overseas research scholarship along with a wealth of other supports during the most painful time of my life. It has been my great pleasure to carry out my PhD study in the RAM-LAB @ HKUST research group. I would like to thank everyone for making it friendly and providing desirable environment for research discussions. Special thanks should be given to the staff in the department administration for all their assistance and patience. I am deeply thankful to my amazing parents and for the way they raised me, without which it would be impossible to be who I am at the moment. Last, I would like to dedicate this thesis and everything I do to my love, who is always with me.
